    "Many public data wesites, such as [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm), [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/), and [U.S. Census](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html), offer application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable users to conveniently retrieve large amounts of data. It is also easier and more efficient to manage the data in Python after pulling it using the API, compared to manual downloads from the websites. Additionally, many developers have already created Python libraries that facilitate easy API usage with predefined functions. The API libraries we will use in this notebook are [**bls**](https://github.com/OliverSherouse/bls) and [**census**](https://pypi.org/project/census/). At the end of this notebook, we will also create two visualizations by using [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/) and [**Plotly**](https://plotly.com/python/)."

I do not recommend this method, because over time, you folder will be flooded with messy data files. In the second method, you should first define the directory of the folder in which you want to save the data (usually a folder designated for data). Then use the `+` sign to concatenate the directory string with the file name string inside of the `to_csv()` function. We can also define `index = False`, which is to avoid export the index of a DataFrame. Otherwise, in your final csv file, the first column would be a list of numbers that represent the index.

In the series id \"LAUCN390010000000003\", **LAUCN** represents the data series. **39** is the [state FIPS code](https://www.bls.gov/respondents/mwr/electronic-data-interchange/appendix-d-usps-state-abbreviations-and-fips-codes.htm) and **001** is the [county FIPS code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Ohio).

    "The code below creates a list of county FIPS codes. It is more complicated than the code we have used in the previous notebook. I suggest you to try each part of the code in a new code cell and explore what they mean. The code `[str(x).zfill(3) for x in np.arange(1, 176,2).tolist()]` consists of the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **`np.arange(1, 176, 2)`**: [Numpy function `np.arange()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html) returns evenly spaced values within a given range. In our example, we specify that we need a list of numbers between 1 and 176 (in the first two parameters of the function). Then, in the third parameter, we specify that the differences between two neighboring numbers (also called steps or spacing values) should be 2. The function itself will return an [array](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_arrays.asp) of numbers that looks like [1, 3, 5, ..., 173, 175].\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **`str(x).zfill(3)`**: Note that the numbers we generated by using `np.arange()` are not exactly in the format we need. In Python, `1` and `'001'` are two completely different objects. `1` is a one-digit integer, while `'001'` is a three-digit string. The two zeros in `'001'` are called leading zeros. To convert `1` to `'001'`, we first need to use the `str()` function to convert `1` to string type and then use the `zfill()` function to add leading zeros. The number we specify within the `zfill()` function indicates how many digits the resulting number should have. You can check the [documentation of `zfill()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_zfill.asp) for more examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **List comprehension**: The code `str(x).zfill(3)` can only be applied to one number at a time. To convert all the numbers in array [1, 3, 5, ..., 173, 175], we need to apply a mini loop, which is called list comprehension. A list comprehension is a concise way to create lists. It consists of an expression followed by a `for` clause. In this case, the expression is str(x).zfill(3) and the for clause iterates over the values generated by np.arange(1, 176, 2). This expression is essentially creating a list of strings where each number generated by np.arange(1, 176, 2) is converted to a string and then padded with zeros to ensure it's at least 3 characters long."

    "Next, we need to loop through all 88 county FIPS codes to get each county's monthly unemployment rates. To initiate a loop, we use the code `for c in county_fips:`. This loop iterates through each element in `county_fips`, assigning each element to the variable `c` in each iteration. For example, in the first iteration, `c` is assigned the value `'001'`. The most important part inside of the loop is the `bls.get_series` function. Here, we change the series id part to `'LAUCN39' + c + '0000000003'`. This allows Python to replace the county FIPS code part with a new value during each iteration. You can check the [`for` loop documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp) to practice more with simple `for` loop commands.\n",

    "2) **`.rename(columns = {})`**: As you have seen in the previous example, after we pull the data, the column name for the unemployment rate is the series id. We should rename the column so that it is easier for us to combine the data and to avoid confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **`ur_temp_df['cnty_fips'] = c`**: Since the data is at county-month level, every time we pull a county's data, we should add an indicator for that county so that later we can tell which county a data point is from. \n",

In this case, we use a data manipulation technique called **append data**. This technique allows us to add rows from one dataset to another dataset. The example below shows how the final data looks like if we append Adams County's and Allen County's data. To append datasets, we use the `pd.concat()` function. Inside of the function, we need to define a list of DataFrame names (`[oh_cnty_ur_df, ur_temp_df]`).

    "In this example, we will pull state level foreign-born population and Ohio school-age population at school district level by using Census API. Similar to the BLS example, before we can use the API, we need to have two things ready:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **A Census API key**: [Click here to register the key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **The column name of the data you want to pull**. The column name of the Census data is similar to the series id for the BLS data. It uniquely identifies a series of data. There are two ways you can find the column name:\n",
    "- The first way is to search for the data on the [census data website](https://data.census.gov/). Search for the key words. For example, you can type \"foreign born\" in the search engine and wait for the options to show up (as shown in the picture below). Then choose \"S0501: Selected Characteristics of the Native and Foreign-Born Populations\". Then download the data as a ZIP file. In the ZIP file, find the \"Column Metadata\" csv file. Search \"foreign born\" in the Metadata file. Finally, you can find the \"Estimate!!Foreign born!!Total population\" and its column name **\"S0501_C03_001E\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second way is to search the data you want on [Census API document](https://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/acs5/subject/variables.html). This document is very long though and is specifically for the 2020 five-year estimates data. When you search for \"foreign born\" in this document, you will get thousands of results. It would be easier if you know the specific table you need, which is **\"S0501\"** in this example. You will find the same information as what you find in the metadata file.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter which method you use, you should thoroughly research the data you need, such as the topics, the geography level available, the years you need, and the types of survey data you need. For most of the analyses, you should use the five-year estimates, since it is relatively more accurate and contains more information at more granular geographic levels than the one-year estimate and three-year estiamtes. You can read the [five-year estimates documentation](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.2022.html#list-tab-1806015614) to learn more."

You can check the Datasets section in the [census API library](https://pypi.org/project/census/) documentation for more information.\n",

You can change this part to other geography levels you need, such as county level (`state_county`) or zip code level (`state_zipcode`). However, due to data limitations, not all geography levels are avaialble for all surveys. Also, even if a geography level is available, due to smaller sample sizes for more granular geography levels, data in some areas may be suppressed. For example, if you search for Ohio foreign-born population at county level, not all counties' data are available to you. Please check the Geographies section in the [census API library](https://pypi.org/project/census/) documentation for more information.\n",

When we merging two DataFrames, we combine them *horizontally*, i.e., rows that have the same values in one or more common columns are combined together.

    "In this example, we will use the data we pulled in section 3.1, `fb_pop_df`. Ideally, you should save your data to a csv file after you pull it by using API. However, since we only have two years of state level data in this case, we will skip this step here. First, let's check if our data has all the elements we need in order to create a map. Note that the only indicator for state is the column `state`, which is the two-digit state FIPS code. Depending on the software/library you use to create the map, state FIPS code may or may not be sufficient. We will use the Plotly library `px.choropleth()` function to create the map in this example. The function only recognizes state abbreviations, such as \"OH\".\n",

    "The easiest way to convert the two-digit state FIPS codes to state abbreviations is to merge our data with a **crosswalk**, such as the **\"us_state_fips.csv\"** file. The crosswalk has three columns: 1) state names, `stname`; 2) state FIPS codes, `state`; and 3) state abbreviations, `stusps`. As long as your data has one of these columns, you can use the crosswalk to convert it to the other two formats. In our example, we just need to merge `fb_pop_df` with the crosswalk `fips_xwalk_df` on the common column `state`. Then our new DataFrame, `fb_pop_st_df`, will contain state abbreviations.\n",
